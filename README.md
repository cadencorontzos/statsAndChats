# statsAndChats

This was a project done for CSCI 221 at Reed College (Fall 2020). There were starter files given for the stats portion, as well as a bit of starter code. The majority of the code, however, was written by me.

The stats part of this project scans through a text and tells the user what words appears most often, and gives a list of the most used words.

The chats part of this project creates bigrams and trigrams, essentially scanning the text, keeping track of which words follow others, and uses this knowledge to emulate text which sounds like the source material.

Both the stats and the chats do their work using a bucketed hash table. Several example texts are given for testing and using.
